🚀 Successfully deployed a SOC monitoring setup using **Wazuh** for enterprise Windows endpoints!

🔐 Project: **Windows Defender Monitoring + VirusTotal Threat Intelligence using Wazuh**
📌 Environment: Ubuntu-based Wazuh Manager + Windows endpoints

✅ What I implemented:
✔ Centralized security monitoring using Wazuh  
✔ Windows Defender event log collection from endpoints  
✔ Malware detection visibility in SOC dashboards  
✔ Threat intelligence enrichment using VirusTotal  
✔ Reporting + alerting workflow for security operations  
✔ Scalable approach for large endpoint environments (AD/GPO ready)
